		<p> Three assignments will be done in this course:</p>
		<ol>
			<li> Assignment 1 - Structured Information</li>
			<p> An XML schema has been created for a bookshelf. The schema contains details of each book, such as its name, author and publisher details. Along with this, it is indicated if the book is presently available or not. Different features of XSD, XSLT and XML have been used for this purpose.
			<li> Assignment 2 - Social Media and Mashups</li>
			<p> We create a web application in which the front-end contains features from different social media services. The information received from the front-end is used in different ways by the server running in the back-end.</p>
			<li> Assignment 3 - Mobile software</li>
			<p> We will create a mobile interface to the application created previously and add special features.</p>
		</ol>
